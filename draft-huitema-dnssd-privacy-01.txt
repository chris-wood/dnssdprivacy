                     Privacy Extensions for DNS-SD
                   draft-huitema-dnssd-privacy-01.txt

Abstract

   DNS-SD allows discovery of services published in DNS or MDNS.  The
   publication normally disclose information about the device publishing
   the services.  There are use cases where devices want to communicate
   without disclosing their identity, for example two mobile devices
   visiting the same hotspot.  We propose a method to obfuscate the
   identification information published by DNS-SD.

1.  Introduction

   DNS-SD [RFC6763] enables distribution and discovery in local networks
   without configuration.  It is very convenient for users, but it
   requires the public exposure of the offering and requesting
   identities along with information about the offered and requested
   services.  Some of the information published by the announcements can
   be very revealing.  These privacy issues and potential solutions are
   discussed in [KW14a] and [KW14b].

   There are cases when nodes connected to a network want to provide or
   consume services without exposing their identity to the other parties
   connected to the same network.  Consider for example a traveler
   wanting to upload pictures from a phone to a laptop when connected to
   the Wi-Fi network of an Internet cafe, or two travelers who want to

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


   share files between their laptops when waiting for their plane in an
   airport lounge.

   We expect that these exchanges will start with a discovery procedure
   using DNS-SD [RFC6763].  One of the devices will publish the
   availability of a service, such as a picture library or a file store
   in our examples.  The user of the other device will discover this
   service, and then connect to it.

   When analyzing these scenarios in Section 2, we find that the DNS-SD
   messages leak identifying information such as instance name, host
   name or service properties.  We review the design constraint of a
   solution in Section 3, and describe the proposed solution in
   Section 4.

1.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Privacy implications of DNS-SD

   DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) is defined in [RFC6763].  It
   allows nodes to publish the availability of an instance of a service
   by inserting specific records in the DNS ([RFC1033], [RFC1034],
   [RFC1035]) or by publishing these records locally using multicast DNS
   (mDNS) [RFC6762].  Available services are described using three types
   of records:

   PTR Record:  Associates a service type in the domain with an
      "instance" name of this service type.

   SRV Record:  Provides the node name, port number, priority and weight
      associated with the service instance, in conformance with
      [RFC2782].

   TXT Record:  Provides a set of attribute-value pairs describing
      specific properties of the service instance.

   In the remaining subsections, we will review the privacy issues
   related to publishing instance names, node names, service attributes
   and other data, as well as review the implications of using the
   discovery service as a client.

2.1.  Privacy implication of publishing Service Instance Names

   In the first phase of discovery, the client obtains all the PTR
   records associated with a service type in a given naming domain.
   Each PTR record contains a Service Instance Name defined in Section 4
   of [RFC6763]:

     Service Instance Name = <Instance> . <Service> . <Domain>

   The <Instance> portion of the Service Instance Name is meant to
   convey enough information for users of discovery clients to easily
   select the desired service instance.  Nodes that use DNS-SD over mDNS
   [RFC6762] in a mobile environment will rely on the specificity of the
   instance name to identify the desired service instance.  In our
   example of users wanting to upload pictures to a laptop in an
   Internet Cafe, the list of available service instances may look like:

   Alice's Images         . _imageStore._tcp . local
   Alice's Mobile Phone   . _presence._tcp   . local
   Alice's Notebook       . _presence._tcp   . local
   Bob's Notebook         . _presence._tcp   . local
   Carol's Notebook       . _presence._tcp   . local

   Alice will see the list on her phone and understand intuitively that
   she should pick the fist item.  The discovery will "just work".

   However, DNS-SD/mDNS will reveal to anybody that Alice is currently
   visiting the Internet Cafe.  It further discloses the fact that she
   uses two devices, shares an image store, and uses a chat application
   supporting the _presence protocol on both of her devices.  She might
   currently chat with Bob or Carol, as they are also using a _presence
   supporting chat application.  This information is not just available
   to devices actively browsing for and offering services, but to
   anybody passively listing to the network traffic.

2.2.  Privacy implication of publishing node names

   The SRV records contain the DNS name of the node publishing the
   service.  Typical implementations construct this DNS name by
   concatenating the "host name" of the node with the name of the local
   domain.  The privacy implications of this practice are reviewed in
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-hostname-practice].  Depending on naming practices,
   the host name is either a strong identifier of the device, or at a
   minimum a partial identifier.  It enables tracking of the device, and
   by extension of the device's owner.

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


2.3.  Privacy implication of publishing service attributes

   The TXT records contain a set of attribute and value pairs
   characteristics of the service implementation.  These attributes
   reveal some information about the devices that publishes the service.
   The amount of information will vary widely with the particular
   service and its implementation:

   o  Some attributes like the paper size available in a printer, are
      the same on many devices, and thus only provides limited
      information to a tracker.

   o  Attributes that have freeform values, such as the name of a
      directory, may reveal much more information.

   Combinations of attributes have more information power than specific
   attributes, and can potentially be used for "fingerprinting" a
   specific device.

2.4.  Device fingerprinting

   The combination of information published in DNS-SD has the potential
   to provide a "fingerprint" of a specific device.  Such information
   includes:

   o  The list of services published by the device, which can be
      retrieved because the SRV records will point to the same host
      name.

   o  The specific attributes describing these services.

   o  The port numbers used by the services.

   o  The values of the priority and weight attributes in the SRV
      records.

   This combination of services and attribute will often be sufficient
   to identify the version of the software running on a device.  If a
   device publishes many services with rich sets of attributes, the
   combination may be sufficient to identify the specific device.

   There is however an argument that devices providing services can be
   discovered by observing the local traffic, because different services
   have different traffic patterns.  The observation could in many cases
   also reveal some specificities of the service's implementation.  Even
   if the traffic is encrypted, the size and the timing of packets may
   be sufficient to reveal that information.  This argument can be used

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


   to assess the priority of, for example, protecting the fact that a
   device publishes a particular service.

2.5.  Privacy implication of discovering services

   The consumers of services engage in discovery, and in doing so do
   reveal some information such as the list of services that they are
   interested in and the domains in which they are looking for the
   services.  When the clients select specific instances of services,
   they reveal their preference for these instances.

   In first analysis, the leakage of information by clients looks benign
   compared to the disclosures made by the servers.  There may be a
   concern when the client is attempting to use rare services.

3.  Design of DNS-SD privacy mitigations

   In this section, we present the design of the privacy mitigations.

3.1.  Obfuscated instance names

   The privacy issues described in Section 2.1 can be solved by
   obfuscating the instance names.  Instead of a user friendly
   description of the instance, the nodes will publish a random looking
   string of characters.  To prevent tracking over time and location,
   different string values should be used at different locations, or at
   different times.

   Authorized parties should be able to "de-obfuscate" the names, while
   non-authorized third parties will not be.  For example, if both Alice
   notebook and Bob's laptop use an obfuscation process, the list of
   available services should appear differently to them and to third
   parties.  Alice's phone will be able to de-obfuscate the name of
   Alice's notebook, but not that of Bob's laptop.  Bob's phone will do
   the opposite.  Carol will do neither.

   Alice will see something like:

   QwertyUiopAsdfghjk (Alice's Images)       . _imageStore._tcp . local
   GobbeldygookBlaBla (Alice's Mobile Phone) . _presence._tcp   . local
   MNbvCxzLkjhGfdEdhg (Alice's Notebook)     . _presence._tcp   . local
   Abracadabragooklybok (Bob's Notebook)     . _presence._tcp   . local
   Carol's Notebook                          . _presence._tcp   . local

   Bob will see:

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


   QwertyUiopAsdfghjk                    . _imageStore._tcp . local
   GobbeldygookBlaBla                    . _presence._tcp   . local
   MNbvCxzLkjhGfdEdhg                    . _presence._tcp   . local
   Abracadabragooklybok (Bob's Notebook) . _presence._tcp   . local
   Carol's Notebook                      . _presence._tcp   . local

   Carol will see:

   QwertyUiopAsdfghjk   . _imageStore._tcp . local
   GobbeldygookBlaBla   . _presence._tcp   . local
   MNbvCxzLkjhGfdEdhg   . _presence._tcp   . local
   Abracadabragooklybok . _presence._tcp   . local
   Carol's Notebook     . _presence._tcp   . local

   In that example, Alice, Bob and Carol will be able to select the
   appropriate instance.  It would probably be preferable to filter out
   the obfuscated instance names, to avoid confusing the user.  In our
   example, Alice and Bob have updated their software to understand
   obfuscation, and they could easily filter out the obfuscated strings
   that they do not like.  But Carol is not using this system, and we
   could argue that her experience is suboptimal.

   The suboptimal experience with unmodified software could be avoided
   if the obfuscated service records were published using different
   service names, or using different domain names.  This would of course
   make management a bit more complex, and is thus debatable.

3.2.  Randomized host names

   Instead of publishing their actual name in the SRV records, nodes
   could publish a randomized name.  That is the solution argued for in
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-hostname-practice].

   Randomized host names will prevent some of the tracking.  Host names
   are typically not visible by the users, and randomizing host names
   will probably not cause much usability issues.

3.3.  Names of obfuscated services

   Instead of publishing the actual service name in the SRV records,
   nodes could publish a randomized name.  There are two plausible
   reasons for doing that:

   o  Having a different service name for privacy enhanced services will
      ensure that hosts that are not privacy aware are not puzzled by
      obfuscated service names.





Huitema & Kaiser        Expires November 27, 2016               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


   o  Using obfuscated service names prevents third parties from
      discovering which service a particular host is providing or
      consuming.

   The first requirement can be met with a simple modification of an
   existing name.  For example, instead of publishing:

   QwertyUiopAsdfghjk . _imageStore._tcp . local
   GobbeldygookBlaBla . _presence._tcp   . local

   Alice could publish some kind of "translation" of the service name,
   such as:

   QwertyUiopAsdfghjk . _vzntrFgber._tcp . local
   GobbeldygookBlaBla . _cerfrapr._tcp   . local

   The previous examples use rot13 translation.  It does not provide any
   particular privacy, but it does ensure that obfuscated services are
   named differently from clear text services.

   Making the service name actually private would require some actual
   encryption.  The main problem with such solutions is that the client
   needs to know the service name in order to compose the DNS-SD query
   for services.  There are several options:

   o  The service name is chosen by the client.  For example, the client
      could encrypt the original service name and a nonce with a key
      shared between client and server.  Upon receiving the queries, the
      server would attempt to decrypt the service name.  If that
      succeeds, the server would respond with PTR records created on the
      fly for the new service name.

   o  The service name is chosen by the server and cannot be predicted
      in advance by the client.  For example, the server could encrypt a
      nonce and the original service name.  The client retrieves such
      services by doing a wild card query, then attempting to decrypt
      the received responses.

   o  The service name is chosen by the server in a way that can be
      predicted in advance by the client.  For example, the server could
      encrypt some version of the data and time and the original service
      name.  The data and time are encoded with a coarse precision,
      enabling the client to predict the value that the server is using,
      and to send the corresponding queries.

   None of these solutions is very attractive.  Creating records on the
   fly is a burden for the server.  If clients must use wildcard
   queries, they will need to process lots of irrelevant data.  If



Huitema & Kaiser        Expires November 27, 2016               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


   clients need to predict different instance names for each potential
   server, they will end up sending batches of queries with many
   different names.  All of these solutions appear like big departures
   from the simplicty and robustness of the DNS-SD design.

   Given the relatively low priority of hiding the service name and the
   complexity of the potential solutions, we are not recommending any
   particular protection for the instance names.

3.4.  Timing of obfuscation and randomization

   It is important that the obfuscation of instance names is performed
   at the right time, and that the obfuscated names change in synchrony
   with other identifiers, such as MAC Addresses, IP Addresses or host
   names.  If the randomized host name changed but the instance name
   remained constant, an adversary would have no difficulty linking the
   old and new host names.  Similarly, if IP or MAC addresses changed
   but host names remained constant, the adversary could link the new
   addresses to the old ones using the published name.

   The problem is handled in [I-D.ietf-intarea-hostname-practice], which
   recommends to pick a new random host name at the time of connecting
   to a new network.  The instance names should be obfuscated at the
   same time, or maybe use the randomized host name as input in the
   randomization process.

3.5.  A note on Private DNS services

   The DNS Private Exchange working group develops mechanisms to provide
   confidentiality to DNS transactions, addressing the problems outlined
   in [RFC7626].  The solutions being developed include DNS over TLS
   [RFC7858] and DNS over DTLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls].

   We could imagine that DNS-SD nodes are configured to update and
   retrieve DNS records using DNS over TLS or DNS over DTLS, but a
   number of problems can arise:

   o  Discovery queries are scoped by the domain name within which
      services are published.  As nodes move and visit arbitrary
      networks, there is no guarantee that the domain services for these
      networks will be accessible using DNS over TLS or DNS over DTLS.

   o  Information placed in the DNS is considered public.  Even if the
      server does support DNS over TLS, third parties will still be able
      to discover the content of PTR, SRV and TXT records.

   o  Neither DNS over TLS nor DNS over DTLS applies to MDNS.

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


   In short, DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS solve a different problem,
   and are not a solution for DNS-SD privacy.

4.  Privacy extensions for DNS-SD

   The proposed solution uses the following components:

   o  The host names are randomized to prevent tracking.

   o  Nodes provide an Instance Discovery Key to other nodes authorized
      to discover the service instance.

   o  The Instance Discovery Key is combined with a random seed to
      obfuscate the instance names.

   o  Nodes engaged in discovery attempt to de-obfuscate the instance
      names using the set of Instance Discovery Keys that they know
      about.

   These components are detailed in the following subsections.

4.1.  Randomized Host Name

   Nodes publishing services with DNS-SD and concerned about their
   privacy MUST use a randomized host name.  The randomized name MUST be
   changed when network connectivity changes, to avid the correlation
   issues described in Section 3.4.  The randomized host name MUST be
   used in the SRV records describing the service instance, and the
   corresponding A or AAAA records MUST be made available through DNS or
   MDNS, within the same scope as the PTR, SRV and TXT records used by
   DNS-SD.

   If the link-layer address of the network connection is properly
   obfuscated (e.g. using MAC Address Randomization), The Randomized
   Host Name MAY be computed using the algorithm described in section
   3.7 of [RFC7844].  If this is not possible, the randomized host name
   SHOULD be constructed by simply picking a 48 bit random number
   meeting the Randomness Requirements for Security expressed in
   [RFC4075], and then use the hexadecimal representation of this number
   as the obfuscated host name.

4.2.  Instance Discovery Key

   The obfuscation and de-obfuscation of instance names is controlled by
   the Instance Discovery Key.  Each device publishing a service
   instance configures an Instance Discovery Key associated with the
   service instance.




Huitema & Kaiser        Expires November 27, 2016              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


   The Instance Key SHOULD be at least 16 bytes long (128 bits).  Its
   content SHOULD meet the Randomness Requirements for Security
   expressed in [RFC4075].

4.3.  Composing Obfuscated Instance Names

   The obfuscated instance name is composed of two components, a seed
   and a hash, encoded in BASE64 ([RFC2045] section 6.8) and separated
   by a dot:

      instance_name = <base64_seed> "." <base64_hash>

   The seed is derived algorithmically from the randomized host name.
   If the randomized name changes, new instance names SHOULD be computed
   and the corresponding records SHOULD be published in order to meet
   the requirement defined in Section 3.4.

   The complete instance name MUST be generated using the following
   process:

      long_seed = HASH(randomized_host_name)
      seed = first 12 bytes of long_seed
      long_hash = HASH(seed | instance_discovery_key )
      instance_hash = first 12 bytes of long_hash
      instance_name = BASE64(seed) "." BASE64(instance_hash)

   In this formula, HASH SHOULD be the function SHA256 defined in
   [RFC4055], unless otherwise specified.  Implementers MAY eventually
   replace SHA256 with a stronger algorithm.

   The algorithm produces seeds and hash that are encoded as 16 BASE64
   characters.  The resulting instance name is 33 characters long, which
   fits within the 63 characters limit defined in [RFC6763].

4.4.  De-Obfuscation of Instance Names

   De-obfuscation of instance names assumes that authorized nodes are
   provisioned with three elements for each discoverable instance:

   o  the de-obfuscated instance name,

   o  a copy of the instance_discovery_key,

   o  optionally, the identifier of the HASH function used by the
      publisher.

   A given node may be provisioned do discover many instances.  For
   example, Alice's phone may know about Alice's laptop and Alice's

   desktop.  It might also know of Bob's laptop, if Alice and Bob have
   agreed to share such information.

   To de-obfuscate the instance names, nodes performing discovery should
   obtain the list of PTR records published for the service and domain
   being searched and then do the following:

   o  Test whether the instance name contains the base64 encoding of a
      seed and hash as defined in Section 4.3.  If it is not in that
      form, the name is not considered obfuscated.

   o  Retrieve the binary seed and hash from the base64 encoding.

   o  For each known instance discovery key, compute whether the hash of
      the seed and key, and compare it to the published hash.

   o  If there is a hash, the de-obfuscated name of the instance is the
      de-obfuscated name associated with the matching instance discovery
      key

5.  Considerations on the pairing requirement

   A problem with the mitigation techniques described so far is the need
   for a pairing.  When service instance keys are used, each service
   instance needs a separate key, which in turn has to be transmitted to
   all devices that should be able to discover the corresponding service
   instance.  This is disadvantageous in two ways.  On the one hand, it
   demands a pairing for each service instance; on the other hand it
   makes it impossible to discover new service instances without prior
   pairing.  Both problems can be mitigated by using the method
   described in the following.

   Privacy Preserving Service Discovery can be divided into three
   (independent) layers.

   o  Device Pairing: In this step users pair their devices.  There are
      two kinds of pairings: (1) intra-user pairing, which is a pairing
      of devices of the same user; this can be done without any
      configuration by a meta-service (pairing data synchronization
      service) in a trusted (home) network; (2) inter-user pairing is a
      pairing between devices of "friends".  Since this has to be done
      manually - e.g. by verifying a fingerprint leveraging QR-Codes -
      it is important to limit it to once per pair of friends.

   o  Directory Discovery: The set of devices that offer service
      instances can be seen as a distributed service directory.  When a
      user wants to discover services, she first discovers the part of
      the service directory she is authorized to use, meaning the

Internet-Draft          DNS-SD Privacy Extensions               May 2016


      devices of her online friends.  This is done using an other meta
      service (private service directory service, PSDS) whose task it is
      to handle queries for actual services.  The connection to this
      service is done using private mutual authentication guaranteeing
      the privacy of both parties.

   o  Service Querying: The PSDS is offered by a small DNS server
      running on each user's device that can be queried for the service
      instances offered by the corresponding user.

   This mitigates both afore mentioned problems as it reduces pairing to
   one pairing per pair of friends and allows to offer services in a
   privacy preserving way whose existence was unknown at the time of
   pairing.  This grants an almost zeroconf user experience.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a method to protect the privacy of service
   publishing nodes.  This is especially useful when operating in a
   public space.  Obfuscating the identity of the publishing nodes
   prevents some forms of "targeting" of high value nodes.

   Obfuscating the identity of the publishing nodes does not provide any
   form of access control.  It will not prevent attackers from trying to
   access the services.

   The cost of the de-obfuscation algorithm scales as the product of the
   number of authorized publishers known by the client, times the number
   of obfuscated services published in the searched name domain.
   Attackers could potentially publish a large number of bogus instances
   of a service, forcing a high computation cost on discovery clients.
   While this potential denial of service attack is concerning, we note
   that this is merely an aggravation of a flooding attacks against DNS-
   SD.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any IANA action.
